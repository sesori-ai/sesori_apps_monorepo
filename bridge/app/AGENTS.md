# Sesori Bridge (Dart)

Dart CLI compiled to native binary. Runs on laptop, authenticates via OAuth PKCE, connects to relay, routes E2E-encrypted traffic between phones and local server. Plugin-based architecture supports multiple backends (OpenCode, Codex, etc.). Manages process lifecycle (SIGTERM on shutdown).

## FILE SIZE
- Maximum file length: 250 lines per production code file
- If a file exceeds 250 lines, split it into smaller focused files (by use-case, component, or concern)
- Prefer many small files over few large files
- Test files are explicitly excluded from this limit

## CONVENTIONS

- **Plugin architecture** — all backend-specific code lives in plugin modules under `modules/`. The bridge `lib/src/` is plugin-agnostic — it only imports from `sesori_plugin_interface`, never from concrete plugins.
- **Intercept-first routing** — requests are intercepted by handlers by default. Proxy is the fallback for unhandled routes, not the default path.
- **Crypto from `sesori_shared`** — all crypto primitives imported from shared package, not duplicated
- **Linting**: `package:lints/recommended.yaml` (lighter than mobile's `all_lint_rules`)
- **Binary distribution**: npm wrapper package with platform-specific optional deps (darwin/linux/windows × arm64/x64)
- **Proper architecture** — network calls go in dedicated API classes (e.g. `OpenCodeApi`), not inlined in business logic. Classes receive dependencies via constructor injection.
- **Always use typed models** — deserialize JSON responses into Freezed objects immediately. Never pass raw `Map<String, dynamic>` or `List<dynamic>` through business logic.
- **API classes return Freezed types** — e.g. `Future<List<Project>>` not `Future<http.Response>`. Parsing lives in the API layer.
- **Constructor injection for testability** — business logic classes (e.g. `ActiveSessionTracker`) receive their API dependency via constructor, enabling fake/mock injection in tests.
- **Prefer typed version value objects** — when bridge code needs version parsing/comparison, parse once into a small typed value object that implements `Comparable`. Keep raw version strings in API/transport DTOs and map them into typed versions in repository code rather than exposing loose `String` comparison helpers.
- **Request bodies use shared Freezed models** — every handler that accepts a JSON body must have a corresponding Freezed request class in `sesori_shared` (e.g. `HideProjectRequest`, `CreateProjectRequest`). Parse with `FooRequest.fromJson(map)` inside a try/catch:
  ```dart
  final FooRequest fooRequest;
  try {
    fooRequest = FooRequest.fromJson(
      jsonDecodeMap(request.body),
    );
  } catch {
    return buildErrorResponse(request, 400, "invalid JSON body");
  }
  ```

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- **Never duplicate crypto** — use `sesori_shared` package for all encryption/protocol types
- **Never hardcode URLs** — relay and auth backend are CLI-configurable. Server is always localhost (only port is configurable)
- **Never inline HTTP calls in business logic** — extract to a dedicated API class with typed return values
- **Never pass raw JSON maps through layers** — always deserialize at the boundary (API class) and use Freezed objects downstream
- **Never construct classes with server URLs/passwords directly** — inject an API client instance instead
- **Never use inline JSON maps for request bodies** — always create a Freezed class in `sesori_shared` and use `toJson()`/`fromJson()`. Never write `body: {"key": value}` in service or handler code.
- **Never split a service into fake helpers that still depend on that same service** — if logic is being extracted into a focused collaborator, it must stand on its own injected dependencies. Do not use `part` files, extensions, or pseudo-helper classes that call back into the owning service, because that keeps same-level coupling and hides circular design.
- **Keep command primitives in standalone dependencies** — shell-facing git or worktree operations belong in a dedicated API/helper dependency that the service composes. `WorktreeService` should orchestrate those collaborators, not attach command execution as service-owned helper methods in another file.

## TESTING

```bash
dart test                                    # Bridge tests
dart test modules/opencode_plugin/           # Plugin tests
dart analyze                                 # Bridge analysis
dart analyze modules/sesori_plugin_interface/ # Interface analysis
dart analyze modules/opencode_plugin/        # Plugin analysis
make build                                   # Compile native binary
```

Test helpers in `test/helpers/test_helpers.dart`: `makeRoomKey()`, `startTestRelayServer()`, `connectTestRelayClient()`

## RELEASE

`make build` produces host binary + Linux cross-compiled binaries. GitHub Actions release workflow builds 5 platform artifacts and a GitHub release from tags; npm publishing is a separate manual workflow-dispatch step keyed by a release tag and used only to publish bootstrap packages.
