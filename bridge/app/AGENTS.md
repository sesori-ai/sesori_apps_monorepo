# Sesori Bridge (Dart)

Dart CLI compiled to native binary. Runs on laptop, authenticates via OAuth PKCE, connects to relay, routes E2E-encrypted traffic between phones and a local AI assistant server. Plugin-based architecture supports multiple backends (OpenCode, Codex, etc.).

## CONVENTIONS

- **Plugin architecture** — all backend-specific code lives in sibling plugin packages under `bridge/` (e.g. `sesori_plugin_opencode`). The bridge `lib/src/` is plugin-agnostic — it only imports from `sesori_plugin_interface`, never from concrete plugins. `bin/bridge.dart`'s registry (`plugin_registry.dart`) imports `opencode_plugin` for the const descriptor — that is the supported descriptor registration point.
- **Plugin CLI options are namespaced** — plugins declare **bare** option names in their descriptor (`port`, `host`, `bin`, …). `PluginCliOptionsMapper` namespaces each to `--<pluginId>-<name>` (e.g. `--opencode-host`) at registration so options can't collide once multiple plugins run in parallel. Never bake the plugin prefix into the declared name. When renaming/migrating a previously un-prefixed flag, keep the old spelling working via `PluginOption.deprecatedAliases` (registered hidden, emits a `Log.w` deprecation when used) rather than breaking existing invocations. Plugin code reads values by the **bare** name through `PluginConfig`, unaware of namespacing.
- **Explicit routing** — every supported route has a dedicated handler; `RequestRouter` returns 404 for unmatched routes (no catch-all proxy).
- **User-facing output vs logging** — use `Console` (from `sesori_plugin_interface`) for anything the user must see to operate the bridge: prompts, requests, the login URL/code, essential startup status, and deprecation nudges. `Console.message` writes to stdout; `Console.warning` (yellow) and `Console.error` (red) write to stderr; none are gated by `--log-level`. Coloring is applied only when stderr is an interactive terminal, so redirected/piped output stays clean. Use `Log` only for diagnostics that can be safely ignored; all `Log` levels write to stderr and are suppressible via `--log-level`. `Log` warning/error lines are colorized (yellow/red) on a terminal, and the `[CallerClass]` tag is shown only at `debug`/`verbose` levels to keep normal output clean. The bridge must stay fully operable with logging silenced (`--log-level error` or `2>/dev/null`), so never put an essential prompt or actionable status behind `Log`.
- **Crypto from `sesori_shared`** — all crypto primitives imported from shared package, not duplicated
- **Linting**: `package:lints/recommended.yaml` (lighter than mobile's `all_lint_rules`)
- **Binary distribution**: npm wrapper package with platform-specific optional deps (darwin/linux/windows × arm64/x64)
- **Proper architecture** — network calls go in dedicated API classes (e.g. `OpenCodeApi`), not inlined in business logic. Classes receive dependencies via constructor injection.
- **BridgePlugin is API-layer in app/** — request handlers must not access `BridgePlugin` directly for session lifecycle flows. Put thin plugin-backed session operations in `SessionRepository`, and put multi-step session workflows like create/archive/unarchive in services.
- **Always use typed models** — deserialize JSON responses into Freezed objects immediately. Never pass raw `Map<String, dynamic>` or `List<dynamic>` through business logic.
- **API classes return Freezed types** — e.g. `Future<List<Project>>` not `Future<http.Response>`. Parsing lives in the API layer.
- **Constructor injection for testability** — business logic classes (e.g. `ActiveSessionTracker`) receive their API dependency via constructor, enabling fake/mock injection in tests.
- **Prefer typed version value objects** — when bridge code needs version parsing/comparison, parse once into a small typed value object that implements `Comparable`. Keep raw version strings in API/transport DTOs and map them into typed versions in repository code rather than exposing loose `String` comparison helpers.
- **Prefer `CompositeSubscription` for multiple owned stream subscriptions** — when a class owns more than one long-lived `StreamSubscription`, store them in a single `CompositeSubscription` and cancel that composite in one place during teardown instead of manually tracking multiple nullable subscription fields.
- **Request bodies use shared Freezed models** — every handler that accepts a JSON body must have a corresponding Freezed request class in `sesori_shared` (e.g. `HideProjectRequest`, `CreateProjectRequest`). Parse with `FooRequest.fromJson(map)` inside a try/catch:
  ```dart
  final FooRequest fooRequest;
  try {
    fooRequest = FooRequest.fromJson(
      jsonDecodeMap(request.body),
    );
  } catch {
    return buildErrorResponse(request, 400, "invalid JSON body");
  }
  ```

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- **Never duplicate crypto** — use `sesori_shared` package for all encryption/protocol types
- **Never hardcode URLs** — relay and auth backend are CLI-configurable. The OpenCode server defaults to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) but its host and port are CLI-configurable too (`--opencode-host`, `--opencode-port`)
- **Never inline HTTP calls in business logic** — extract to a dedicated API class with typed return values
- **Never pass raw JSON maps through layers** — always deserialize at the boundary (API class) and use Freezed objects downstream
- **Never construct classes with server URLs/passwords directly** — inject an API client instance instead
- **Never use inline JSON maps for request bodies** — always create a Freezed class in `sesori_shared` and use `toJson()`/`fromJson()`. Never write `body: {"key": value}` in service or handler code.
- **Never split a service into fake helpers that still depend on that same service** — if logic is being extracted into a focused collaborator, it must stand on its own injected dependencies. Do not use `part` files, extensions, or pseudo-helper classes that call back into the owning service, because that keeps same-level coupling and hides circular design.
- **Do not use top-level/global functions for non-trivial bridge logic** — extracting 20-100 lines of decision-making into free functions is not an acceptable file-splitting strategy. If logic is substantial enough to deserve its own file, make it a named collaborator class with explicit constructor-injected dependencies and test it directly.
- **Never extract a class only for file-length pressure** — the extracted collaborator must own lifecycle, state or invariants, a stable domain responsibility, or a multi-caller decision boundary. If it owns none of those, keep the logic as private methods in the original class.
- **Keep command primitives in standalone dependencies** — shell-facing git or worktree operations belong in a dedicated API/helper dependency that the service composes. `WorktreeService` should orchestrate those collaborators, not attach command execution as service-owned helper methods in another file.

For push code specifically, `PushDispatcher` owns only outbound push sends (immediate sends, completion sends, rate limiting, payload construction, and client disposal). `CompletionPushListener` owns SSE-driven tracker/notifier bookkeeping plus abort suppression, and `MaintenancePushListener` owns the timer lifecycle, maintenance-step sequencing, and maintenance telemetry/logging.

## TESTING

```bash
# Run all commands from the bridge/ workspace root.
make analyze                                   # Analyze all bridge modules
make test                                      # Test all bridge modules
(cd app && make build)                         # Compile the native binary

# Target a single module (the subshell keeps your shell at bridge/):
(cd app && dart test)                          # Bridge app tests only
(cd sesori_plugin_opencode && dart test)       # OpenCode plugin tests only
(cd sesori_plugin_interface && dart analyze)   # Interface analysis only
(cd sesori_plugin_opencode && dart analyze)    # Plugin analysis only
```

Test helpers in `test/helpers/test_helpers.dart`: `makeRoomKey()`, `startTestRelayServer()`, `connectTestRelayClient()`

## RELEASE

`make build` produces host binary + Linux cross-compiled binaries. GitHub Actions release workflow builds 5 platform artifacts from release tags, creates the GitHub Release, and then publishes the npm bootstrap packages automatically via npm trusted publishing from that same workflow.
