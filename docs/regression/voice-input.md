# Voice Input

## Capability

The mobile composer records speech while the user holds the mic control, uploads the audio to the Sesori auth server
for transcription, and inserts the text into the prompt field for review before sending. A voice-first or text-first
preference decides which control leads. The device microphone and transcription endpoint are external. The bridge
independently prepares optional project-scoped vocabulary from bounded local evidence; no backend plugin participates.

## Required Behavior

- Recording starts only with microphone permission. Denial or a failing check gives a distinct permission error and
  never leaves the composer stuck.
- One interaction at a time: a concurrent start is ignored, and a release during recorder startup discards the
  incomplete recording.
- Starting, recording, transcribing, and cancelling are mutually exclusive composer interactions; input from a stale
  interaction cannot reset or append text into a newer one.
- Each composer requests current-project context in the background, refreshes missing context for later interactions,
  and snapshots only a validated, bridge-issued opaque glossary key when an interaction starts. Missing, pending,
  invalid, unsupported, or failed context remains unscoped without delaying capture. Retry preserves the original
  snapshot, and raw project identity never reaches auth.
- While recording the composer shows live amplitude, holds a stable layout, keeps the screen awake, and offers
  drag-to-cancel; recording reaches a maximum duration and signals auto-stop instead of running indefinitely.
- Initial cancel stops the recorder, releases the wake lock, attempts audio-file deletion, and invalidates any
  in-flight transcription so a late response cannot land in a newer interaction. Cancelling a manual retry returns
  to the saved-recording state without deleting its artifact.
- An empty or zero-byte recording fails as a recording error and is never uploaded as success. Errors map to distinct
  outcomes for permission, recording, auth, terminal server rejection, retryable server failure, empty transcript,
  local network failure, missing saved recording, and cancellation.
- A local transport failure or server response with authoritative `retryable: true` retains the exact completed async
  artifact and exposes persistent Retry and Discard actions in the composer. Retry reuses its path and MIME type
  without starting the recorder again; repeated retryable failures keep the same artifact.
- A server response with `retryable: false`, omitted/malformed retryability, authentication failure, empty transcript,
  missing artifact, success, explicit discard, a valid submission of other composer content, initial cancellation, or
  composer disposal attempts deletion and shows no Retry action. A valid submission cancels any active manual retry
  before deletion and is serialized so it cannot send twice; a refused/invalid submission retains the recording.
  Deletion remains best-effort and logs failures.
- Text is inserted for review, never auto-sent. The draft tracks voice-origin spans, so a message retaining one counts
  as voice-assisted input.
- Successful transcription reports one content-free analytics event. No audio, transcript, or prompt text reaches logs
  or analytics.
- A successful current-project load or a project entering the active-view set starts best-effort bridge glossary
  population. Both triggers delegate to one serialized coordinator that coalesces concurrent work for the same project
  and never delays the route response, recording, or transcription.
- Glossary population derives an exact opaque repository or bridge-local scope, caches the validated key for later
  current-project responses, scans bounded local Git/filesystem evidence, filters credential-shaped content before
  tokenization, and reconciles at most 50 deterministic terms. Only the opaque scope and filtered terms leave the
  bridge. Scope, scan, or publication failure leaves voice input available without an updated glossary.
- The preference defaults to voice-first, persists, and falls back to voice-first on a corrupt or unknown stored
  value.

## Regression Levels

| Level | Additional coverage |
|---|---|
| L1 Smoke | Not included because microphone and transcription setup is too expensive for a heartbeat. |
| L2 Routine | Automated, mobile client and bridge, no plugin, fake recorder, HTTP client, Git, and filesystem: permission denial, concurrent-start rejection, zero-byte rejection, cancel invalidating an in-flight upload, authoritative true/false/omitted/malformed retryability mapping, retained-artifact Retry/Discard and retry cancellation, serialized send-time abandonment including an active retry, available/pending/invalid opaque project context, terminal/missing cleanup, max-duration signalling, deletion failure logging, draft voice-span and input-mode derivation, current-project/active-view glossary triggers, serialized bounded inference, exact-scope reconciliation, and shutdown cancellation. |
| L3 Release | Client end to end on the release-target client platform: hold to record, release to transcribe, transcript inserted and editable, drag-to-cancel, layout stability, and the voice-first/text-first preference changing which control leads. |
| L4 Extended | Client end to end on the release-target client platform: background or system interruption, permission revoked between interactions, offline async upload failure followed by successful Retry without re-recording, explicit retryable and terminal server outcomes, older-server omission fallback, discard/disposal cleanup, wake lock released on every path. |
| L5 Full | Real device microphone and live transcription endpoint on every supported mobile platform: audible speech yields usable text, a near-maximum recording auto-stops and still transcribes, iOS haptics and system sounds stay audible while recording. |

## Exploration Guidance

Vary hold duration near the minimum and the limit, release timing relative to recorder startup, and whether the field
already contains typed text. Alternate cancel methods, edit or delete part of the inserted text before sending to
exercise voice-span survival, and switch the preference between interactions. On hardware, vary ambient noise and
interruptions such as a call.

## Failure Signals

- The composer stays in a recording or transcribing state after error, cancel, or disposal, or a cancelled transcript
  appears in a later interaction.
- A retryable async failure loses the artifact or lacks persistent Retry/Discard controls; a terminal/unknown failure
  exposes Retry; a manual retry invokes the recorder; a retry cancellation deletes the saved recording; send-time
  abandonment duplicates a submission or lets a retry finish into the cleared composer; cleanup is not attempted on
  terminal paths; a deletion failure is unlogged; or the wake lock stays held.
- Audio is uploaded despite denied permission, or denial is reported as a generic network or server failure.
- Text is sent without review, or a message with surviving voice text is classified as typed.
- Any audio, transcript, or prompt content reaches logs or analytics; raw project identity, project paths, repository
  origins, filenames, or metadata source text reach auth voice transport; glossary failure blocks recording or
  transcription; or concurrent
  triggers run overlapping local scans.

## Known Limitations

- Microphone and hosted transcription are external and non-deterministic; assert usable non-empty text, never exact
  wording. Simulators and fakes cannot prove real capture, iOS audio-session behavior, or haptics; those stay partial
  without L5.
- Transcription is unavailable while unauthenticated or offline, which is expected degraded behavior. Mobile only:
  desktop and bridge have no voice capability.
- Retained recordings are composer-local and memory-owned. They do not survive composer disposal, route replacement,
  process restart, or a valid submission of other composer content. Failed best-effort deletion can still leave an
  unowned audio file on disk.
- Manual Retry has no exactly-once guarantee. If the provider completed work but the response was lost, resubmitting the
  same artifact can repeat provider processing and quota usage.
